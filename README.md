# RNAseq-Analysis
This repository is for showcasing different analytical approaches to analyze sequencing data. I do promise to update the annotation and make it more informative
in the near future. Most of the code is from open sourced tutorials and workflows which can be easily found online with a few datasets from my analysis work
from my studies.
